# Email Classifier

This is a Python program that uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify emails as 'spam' or 'ham'. The program reads emails from files, preprocesses the emails, trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on the data, makes predictions on a sample of emails, and evaluates the accuracy of the model on a test set.
